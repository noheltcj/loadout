## Common Commands
- `./gradlew assemble`: Build all executables.
- `./build/bin/macosArm64/releaseExecutable/loadout.kexe --help`: Run the built binary's help command.

Only execute gradle commands when asked to do so. Also, substitute the current system architecture as necessary when running or testing built binaries.
