# üéí Loadout CLI

> Composable, shareable `.md` system prompts for agentic AI coding systems.  
> A Kotlin Multiplatform (KMP) CLI for composing `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, and other prompt fragments into production-ready `.md` profiles.

---

## üìñ Overview

**Loadout CLI** is a command-line tool implemented with Kotlin Multiplatform to provide a single, well-tested binary on macOS, Linux, and Windows. It encourages a modular, maintainable workflow for system prompts by letting you compose short Markdown fragments into final agent specifications.

Key benefits:
- **CLI-first**: designed to be scriptable and CI-friendly.
- **Composable**: re-use fragments across agents and projects.
- **Open Source**: source-first workflow and easy local builds.

---

## ‚ú® Features

- Compose multiple `.md` files selectively into one final `.md` file.
- Simple, consistent CLI with piping and file output support.
- Designed for fast local development and CI integration.

---

## ‚úÖ Prerequisites (for development / building)

- Java 11+ (to run Gradle tasks / JVM-based distributions)
- Git
- macOS / Linux / Windows terminal (PowerShell / WSL supported)
- `./gradlew` is available in the repo (Gradle wrapper)

> The project targets Kotlin Multiplatform; for production native builds we use the appropriate target configured in Gradle. You do **not** need a local Kotlin toolchain to run most release binaries.

## üöÄ Recommended Install Methods

### 1) Homebrew (macOS / Linux)
When we publish bottles, the easiest way for macOS and Linux users will be Homebrew:

```bash
# Install the CLI
brew tap noheltcj/loadout-tap
brew install noheltcj/loadout

# After install, run:
loadout --help
```

---

### 2) GitHub Releases (Windows / Manual install)
If you prefer manual installation or are on a platform without a package manager, download a release archive:

```bash
# Download and extract (example for macOS x86_64)
curl -L -o loadout.tar.gz \
  "https://github.com/noheltcj/loadout/releases/download/v0.1.0/loadout-cli-mingw-x86.tar.gz"
tar -xzf loadout.tar.gz
# Move the binary into your PATH
sudo mv loadout /usr/local/bin/loadout
loadout --version
```

---

### 3) Build from source (recommended for contributors)

The repository includes Gradle build scripts that support JVM and native targets. From the project root:

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/noheltcj/loadout.git
cd loadout

# Use the Gradle wrapper to build the native executable
./gradlew build

# After successful build, the release binary will be at:
# build/bin/<your_cpu_architecture>/releaseExecutable/loadout.kexe
./build/bin/<your_cpu_architecture>/releaseExecutable/loadout.kexe --help
```

If the project includes native targets (Kotlin/Native or GraalVM native-image), there will be additional Gradle tasks such as:

```bash
# Example native-ish assemble (task name will depend on the build setup)
./gradlew assemble
# Or a more specific native task (configured in the project)
./gradlew assembleMacosX64
```

---

## ‚ö° Quick Start ‚Äî CLI Usage

It's recommended to add CLAUDE.md, AGENTS.md, and .loadout.json to your .gitignore as these will be managed by the tool:

```gitignore
# Loadout CLI generated files and config
.loadout.json
CLAUDE.md
AGENTS.md
```

```bash
# Display your current loadout
loadout

# List available loadouts
loadout list

# Swap to a loadout
loadout use <name>
# Preview without writing files
loadout use <name> --dry-run
 

# Create an empty loadout
loadout create <name> \
  --desc "Short description"

# Create a loadout with fragments
loadout create <name> \
  --desc "Short description" \
  --fragments prompts/base.md prompts/tools.md

# Add a local fragment to your loadout
loadout add prompts/new-tool.md --to <name> --after prompts/base.md

# Remove a local fragment from your loadout
loadout remove prompts/old-experiment.md --from <name>
```

---

## üõ† CLI Options
- `--config <file>`: Path to config (e.g. `.loadout.yml`).
- `--dry-run`: Preview actions and composition; no changes.
- `--output <dir>`: Override output directory for generated files.
- `--json`: Emit machine-readable output for `list` / `inspect`.
- `--version` / `--help`: Print version or help.

Commands execute by default and update outputs; use `--dry-run` to preview without making changes.

(Exact flags depend on the current CLI implementation; use `loadout --help`.)

---

## üßë‚Äçüíª Development notes

- The CLI codebase uses Kotlin Multiplatform to share logic, tooling, and serializable entities with the backend.
- Prefer the Gradle wrapper (`./gradlew`) so CI and contributors run the same toolchain.
- Keep core composition logic platform-agnostic; CLI plumbing lives under `cli/` module.

## üßë‚Äçü§ù‚Äçüßë Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Here's a typical workflow:

1. Fork the repo.
2. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature`.
3. Run tests: `./gradlew check`.
4. Open a PR with a clear description and small, focused commits.

See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for detailed guidelines (code style, commit conventions, CI checks).
